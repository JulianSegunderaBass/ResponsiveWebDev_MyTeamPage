<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Creating the grid system for this project was very satisfying. The biggest challenge I had was working with the rotated position title for each person. I spent a lot of time working on transforming those elements without realizing I also needed to edit the transform origin to get things placed exactly where I wanted them to be. I also used transform effects to create the alternating position look for some of the cards.
